*Warning! Unfinished stuff*

## Uncleaned shits inside(TM):

 - Mixed `CR LF` and `LF`.
 - Ugly action icons.
 - For windows build, win32 APIs are used.
 - No license file provided.
 - No drag-window-border-to-resize support under non-windows platforms (I use <kbd>Meta+Drag</kbd> to resize window under my x11 desktop).
